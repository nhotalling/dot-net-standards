# REST API Communication

## API Consumption

When creating code that will consume a REST API, The library RestSharp MAY be
used.

[http://restsharp.org/](http://restsharp.org/)

Otherwise, roll your own client using `System.Net.Http.HttpClient`.  When
using .NET Core you should make use of `IHttpClientFactory` and typed
clients. See the 
[Microsoft Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/http-requests)
for implementation patterns.

Any sensitive API keys or necessary information to protect security MUST use
proper configuration management techniques. See
[Configuration](configuration.md) for more information.

## Framework

For creating REST APIs, the ASP.NET Core framework SHOULD be used.

## Authorization

This will largely depend on the specific project requirements, but in general,
for authorized access to the API, in general:

**Server-to-server**: For use cases where a server or known system needs to
communicate with our API, keyed-hash message authentication code (HMAC) SHOULD
be used. See
[http://bitoftech.net/2014/12/15/secure-asp-net-web-api-using-api-key-authentication-hmac-authentication/](http://bitoftech.net/2014/12/15/secure-asp-net-web-api-using-api-key-authentication-hmac-authentication/)
for an example.

**Client-to-Server**: For use cases where a client user (such as a browser or
app) needs to communicate with the API, OAuth or other authentication methods
SHOULD be implemented for access.

## Definition and Discovery

One of the biggest missing pieces in REST when compared to other HTTP API
methods such as SOAP, is discoverability. Documentation for REST APIs SHOULD
take place in the form of a webpage.

For this, we recommend the use of Swagger / OpenAPI initiative.
([http://swagger.io/](http://swagger.io/)) For .NET REST Web API projects, we
recommend the use of Swashbuckle
([https://github.com/domaindrivendev/Swashbuckle](https://github.com/domaindrivendev/Swashbuckle))

If the intended consumer of the API is the general public, or some potentially
unknown consumers in the future (e.g., not just 1 client ever), Full
documentation, including some simple examples, SHOULD be included for all
endpoints that are created.

For internal developers or client developers, basic documentation including
endpoints are required. Full descriptions and write ups are not necessary unless
not obvious based on usage.

## Versioning

To ensure proper servicing of multiple clients that are using API endpoints we
wish to modify or deprecate, API endpoints MUST begin from a Base URL that
contains a version identifier.

e.g., `https://<host>/api/v1/<resource path>`, `https://<host>/api/v2/<resource path>`

This allows APIs to remain backward compatible when publishing updates.

When modifying the API spec that would bring in a breaking change, the version
number of the API MUST be updated. Previous versions of the API MUST remain
operational. Your projectâ€™s code architecture SHOULD account for this change to
take place at some point in the future, but API versions SHOULD NOT be updated
frequently, if ever.

Ideally you will only ever have 1 API endpoint that you update with only
forward-non-breaking changes. However, once you do have a breaking change and
have consumers of a production endpoint, you MUST add a new version.

## Content Type

JSON SHOULD be the content type published by your API.

Beginning in .NET Core 3.0, you SHOULD use `System.Text.Json` and the
new built-in support. For earlier versions of .NET Core and .NET
framework projects, the Newtonsoft.JSON serializer that ships with 
Web API SHOULD be used.
